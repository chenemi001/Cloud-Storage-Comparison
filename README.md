## ðŸŽ¥ Video Summary
This video provides a **15-20 minute** in-depth comparison of the three major cloud storage providers: **Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure**. It covers key features, use cases, and their role in modern distributed systems.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points Covered:
1. **Introduction to Cloud Storage & Distributed Systems**
   - Importance of cloud storage in modern applications.
   - Use cases: scalable web applications, media streaming, enterprise data storage.

2. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - Highly scalable object storage.
   - Use of **S3 buckets** and storage classes.
   - Security options: IAM policies, ACLs, and signed URLs.
   - Integration with **AWS CloudFront for CDN** and Lambda for serverless processing.
   
3. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**
   - Easy-to-use storage service with **multi-region** support.
   - Ideal for machine learning and data analytics.
   - Security through IAM roles and Signed URLs.
   - Integration with **Google BigQuery, Firebase, and Cloud CDN**.

4. **Azure Blob Storage**
   - Optimized for unstructured data storage.
   - Supports **hot, cool, and archive tiers** for cost optimization.
   - **Role-based access control (RBAC)** and Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for security.
   - Works well with **Microsoft ecosystem (Azure Functions, Active Directory, etc.)**.

5. **Comparing Performance & Pricing**
   - AWS vs. GCS vs. Azure: which is the best for **latency, redundancy, and pricing**?
   - Benchmarking **upload/download speeds** and CDN effectiveness.
   
6. **Real-World Applications & Use Cases**
   - Which cloud service is best for startups, enterprises, and developers?
   - Case studies on media streaming, AI/ML storage, and secure data backup.
